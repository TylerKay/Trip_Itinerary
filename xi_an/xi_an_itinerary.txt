1 Day Mount Hushan Hiking - Strongly Recommended

With the help of cable cars, you can finish Huashan hiking in a single day. 
But you’d better get to the tourist center at the foot of the mountain in the early morning before 8:30, 
or you will have to wait in long lines to purchase tickets, ride sightseeing bus and wait for cable car.
