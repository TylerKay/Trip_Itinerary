    Alternatively, you can get a taxi between the two from anywhere in the city. 
    Just show them the Chinese for Wulingyuan Scenic Area: 武陵源景区, or the Chinese name for the specific spot you're trying to get to at the scenic area (for example if you're staying at a hotel nearby).

    Taxis will go a little faster than buses, and take just over 30 minutes. Expect to pay between 80 and 150 RMB,

    At night, when there are no more buses, you'll be looking at closer to 150 RMB.
